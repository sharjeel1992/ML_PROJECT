\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Flight Delay Predictor \uc0\u9992 \u65039 \
\
A machine learning project designed to reduce flight delays by analyzing historical data and predicting future delays. This project focuses on identifying avoidable delays that airline executives can act upon.\
\
---\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56524  Mission\
- Analyze **2018 flight data** to understand key factors contributing to delays.\
- Predict delays for **2019 flights** to help avoid predictable disruptions.\
\
Airline executives are primarily interested in delays **within their control** and not those caused by uncontrollable events or prior flights.\
\
---\
\
## \uc0\u55358 \u56800  Approaches\
Two predictive modeling approaches were implemented:\
1. **Regression** \'96 Predict the number of minutes a flight will be delayed.\
2. **Classification** \'96 Predict whether a flight will be delayed by more than 15 minutes.\

## \uc0\u55357 \u56616  Preparation Steps\
- Data preprocessing and cleaning\
- Feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables)\
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights\
- Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn\
