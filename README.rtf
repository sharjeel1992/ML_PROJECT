# Flight Delay Predictor ✈️

A machine learning project designed to reduce flight delays by analyzing historical data and predicting future delays. This project focuses on identifying avoidable delays that airline executives can act upon.

---

## 📌 Mission
- Analyze **2018 flight data** to understand key factors contributing to delays.
- Predict delays for **2019 flights** to help avoid predictable disruptions.

Airline executives are primarily interested in delays **within their control** and not those caused by uncontrollable events or prior flights.

---

## 🧠 Approaches
Two predictive modeling approaches were implemented:
1. **Regression** – Predict the number of minutes a flight will be delayed.
2. **Classification** – Predict whether a flight will be delayed by more than 15 minutes.

## 🔨 Preparation Steps
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights
- Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset was too large for GitHub and has been removed from the repository.
